Hello, i am Alvee, completed my B.Sc in CSE from AUST, Dhaka, Bangladesh. I am also an entrepreneur and i have two startups named impedancePlus & proyogLab. Previously I had the oppurtunity to work as an R&D programmer handling diversified task of ML and Embedded-SW at Octagon Danışmanlık, a startup based in Istanbul, Turkiye. I am currently working as a SWE along side maintaining my company proyogLab. I have always been interested in engineering and physics-math, hence took CSE purely out of passion. 
My company impedancePlus , is an in-depth Engineering-Education platform and Electronics-Robotics-Iot Tech-Product company which is fully relevant to my field of study. 
Me and impedancePlus team is highly committed in producing high quality and polished Electronics-Robotics-Iot-Software products.I founded impedancePlus at 17th of July, 2020 at the end of my 2nd Year 1st Semester. With few of my friends, I have been really working hard on my startup and had been able to generate fairly handsome revenue till date. I have also managed to establish it as a newbie local brand of such category.
I am Currently living in Dhaka, Bangladesh. My hobby Includes:
Using and exploring Electronics-Robotics and Tech related devices such as : Arduino, ESP32, IoT Devices and so on.
Traveling and tourism
Eating Foods at fancy Restaurants
Playing PC Games [ PC_MASTER RACE ]
